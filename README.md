### Introduction <a id="intro"></a>

This framework mimics the extensive use of dependency injection in ASP. NET from instance injection, service injection to yaml mapping object injection. All injected instances can be used through the life cycle, instructions, event listeners, and all injected instances. In addition, service injection provides an API development environment based on interface programming, which facilitates the implementation of SOLID principles and increases scalability and maintainability.

### Advantage <a id="pros"></a>

In the advantage of DI, you don't need to

* create lots of static variable
* initialize instance from another instance
* inject many singletons from your constructor

Moreover, this framework has been designed its own style different with Bukkit API, like

* Extremely easy to create sub commands
* Command argument parsing
* Subscribe event and filter 
* Extremely easy to manipulate yaml with ORM
* Extremely easy to manipulate multiple yamls inside a folder
